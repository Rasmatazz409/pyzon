# Pyzon - by T. Rasmussen
------------------------
**Pyzon** is a text-based adventure game done both as a pet project as well as a coding challenge to stretch my skills.  It is ultimately meant to be a fully-playable game demo that brings a variety of features and - to those outside of development - appears to be a full-fledged text-based game rather than just a technical demo.  The game is written entirely in Python 3.10.0.

Pyzon is brought to GitHub in order to control versions and changes without breaking current gameplay as well as provide means for backup in case of offline drive failure.
